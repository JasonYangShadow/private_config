i3.bak is the configuration file of my i3 window manager
i changed some shortcuts to be adapt to my keyboard.


vimrc.bak is the configuration file of my vim. It contains basic plugins that i need. Check it out and install vundle first then use the command 'PluginInstall' to automatically add the plugins.
'''attention that, one needs to create colors folder under ~/.vim/colors and copy color theme to it. otherwise, the vim will shows error on color theme not found.
